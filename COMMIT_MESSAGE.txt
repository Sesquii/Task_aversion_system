feat(analytics): implement stored factor system with database migration and debugging tools

- Add serendipity_factor and disappointment_factor columns to TaskInstance model
- Create automatic factor calculation on task completion (_calculate_and_store_factors_db)
- Implement migration script to backfill factors for existing data (migrate_factors_to_database.py)
- Add schema migration script to add factor columns (add_factor_columns.py)
- Update analytics.py to use stored factors with automatic fallback calculation
- Update factors_comparison_analytics.py to use stored data with hybrid approach
- Fix JSON serialization issues with pandas Timestamp objects in chart rendering
- Add comprehensive debugging tools with Run Debug button and detailed output
- Fix data loading logic to properly check stats.total_tasks instead of top-level key
- Convert Timestamp objects to Python datetime for Plotly compatibility
- Convert Timestamp objects to strings in recent_tasks dict for JSON serialization

Files created:
- task_aversion_app/migrate_factors_to_database.py
- task_aversion_app/add_factor_columns.py
- task_aversion_app/docs/factor_storage_analysis.md
- task_aversion_app/docs/factor_migration_guide.md

Files modified:
- task_aversion_app/backend/database.py (added factor columns to TaskInstance)
- task_aversion_app/backend/instance_manager.py (auto-calculate factors on completion)
- task_aversion_app/backend/analytics.py (use stored factors with fallback)
- task_aversion_app/ui/factors_comparison_analytics.py (use stored data, fix serialization, add debugging)

Technical improvements:
- Hybrid storage approach: factors stored in database for performance, calculated on-the-fly as fallback
- Idempotent migration script: safe to run multiple times, only updates missing factors
- Comprehensive debugging: Run Debug button with detailed data flow analysis
- JSON serialization fixes: proper handling of pandas Timestamp objects throughout
- Data validation: robust checks for missing data and proper error handling

Performance benefits:
- Fast queries: factors stored in database, can be indexed and filtered directly
- Reduced computation: no need to recalculate factors on every analytics query
- Backward compatible: automatic fallback calculation for old data without factors
