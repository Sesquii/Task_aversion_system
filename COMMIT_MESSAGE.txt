Fix monitored metrics performance and functionality issues

This commit addresses critical performance and functionality issues with the
monitored metrics feature that was causing dashboard slowdowns and timeouts.

Performance Improvements:
- Dashboard now loads instantly (was 30+ seconds)
- Analytics page loads in ~6 seconds (was timing out after 30+ seconds)
- Implemented lazy loading for metrics section using ui.timer to defer
  expensive operations until after initial render
- Metrics load in background: ~20s initial, ~15s on reload
  (get_all_scores_for_composite is the remaining bottleneck at ~17-20s)

Functionality Fixes:
- Fixed edit dialog to show all 24 available metrics (was only showing 2)
- Fixed metric value retrieval: metrics now correctly display values from
  quality_metrics, composite_scores, and relief_summary
- Fixed closure capture issue: ensure data is loaded before creating closures
  for get_value functions
- Metrics that work: productivity_time, productivity_score, stress_level,
  net_wellbeing, net_wellbeing_normalized, stress_efficiency,
  thoroughness_score, thoroughness_factor

Remaining Issues:
- Tooltips: productivity_time tooltip is blank but appears; other tooltips
  show "no history data" (history data retrieval needs investigation)
- Metrics load time: get_all_scores_for_composite() takes 17-20 seconds
  and is the primary bottleneck for metrics loading
- Some metrics return 0 when they shouldn't (needs further investigation)

Technical Changes:
- Added comprehensive instrumentation logging for debugging
- Consolidated lazy loading in load_and_render() to fetch all data before
  rendering metrics
- Fixed JavaScript tooltip initialization to correctly target tooltip
  containers
- Added exception handling and logging throughout metrics rendering pipeline
- Modified render_monitored_metrics_section_loaded() to accept pre-loaded
  quality_metrics and composite_scores

Files Modified:
- ui/dashboard.py: Lazy loading, closure fixes, tooltip fixes, instrumentation
- ui/analytics_page.py: Lazy loading for composite scores, import fixes
- backend/analytics.py: Added get_all_monitored_metrics_options() method

Assessment: 7/10 - Major performance improvements and core functionality
working, but tooltip history data and metrics load time still need work.
