feat(popups): implement popup system infrastructure and initial slider reminder popup

Implement complete popup system infrastructure with database models, state management,
dispatcher service, and UI integration. Add initial popup trigger (7.1) that reminds
users to adjust sliders before completing/initializing tasks to maintain emotional
regulation awareness.

Features:
- Popup system infrastructure with database-backed state management
- Trigger 7.1: "No sliders adjusted" reminder popup
- Tiered messaging system (first time = brief, repeats = more direct)
- Daily popup cap system (default: 5, configurable via user preferences)
- Cooldown system (24 hours default per trigger)
- Popup modal UI with "Continue" and "Edit" options
- Helpful toggle and optional feedback collection
- Integration in complete_task.py and initialize_task.py
- Graceful fallback if database unavailable

Technical Implementation:
- Database models: PopupTrigger (tracks counts, cooldowns, feedback) and PopupResponse (logs)
- PopupStateManager: CRUD operations, cooldown checks, daily count tracking, tier calculation
- PopupDispatcher: Trigger evaluation, priority system, tiered message selection
- Popup modal component: Reusable UI with options, helpful toggle, feedback collection
- Slider change detection: Compares current values to defaults/initialization values

Database Schema:
- popup_triggers table: user_id, trigger_id, task_id, count, last_shown_at, helpful, last_response, last_comment
- popup_responses table: user_id, trigger_id, task_id, instance_id, response_value, helpful, comment, context

Files created:
- task_aversion_app/backend/popup_state.py
  - PopupStateManager class for state management and CRUD operations
  - Methods: get_trigger_state, increment_trigger_count, update_trigger_feedback, check_cooldown, get_daily_popup_count, log_popup_response, get_trigger_tier

- task_aversion_app/backend/popup_dispatcher.py
  - PopupDispatcher class for trigger evaluation and popup content generation
  - Methods: evaluate_triggers, _evaluate_trigger_7_1, _get_trigger_7_1_message, handle_popup_response
  - Implements trigger 7.1 with tiered messaging (tier 0, 1-2, 3+)

- task_aversion_app/ui/popup_modal.py
  - show_popup_modal() function for displaying popups
  - Supports title, message, options, helpful toggle, feedback collection

Files modified:
- task_aversion_app/backend/database.py
  - Added PopupTrigger model (tracks trigger state per user/task)
  - Added PopupResponse model (logs popup shows and responses)

- task_aversion_app/backend/user_state.py
  - Added get_popup_daily_cap() method
  - Added set_popup_daily_cap() method
  - Stores popup_daily_cap preference in user_preferences.csv

- task_aversion_app/ui/complete_task.py
  - Added slider change detection (compares current values to defaults)
  - Integrated popup evaluation before submission
  - Shows popup if no sliders adjusted, handles "continue" vs "edit" responses

- task_aversion_app/ui/initialize_task.py
  - Added slider change detection (compares current values to defaults)
  - Integrated popup evaluation before save
  - Shows popup if no sliders adjusted, handles "continue" vs "edit" responses

Popup Trigger 7.1 Details:
- Fires when user attempts to complete/initialize without adjusting any sliders
- Tier 0 (first time): Brief, encouraging message about accurate tracking
- Tier 1-2 (repeats): More direct message about emotional regulation
- Tier 3+ (habitual): Supportive but clear reminder about maintaining awareness
- Includes optional reinforcement message about emotional tracking benefits
- Options: "Continue" (proceed anyway) or "Edit" (go back to adjust sliders)

Settings:
- Daily popup cap: Configurable via user_state.set_popup_daily_cap() (default: 5)
- Cooldown: 24 hours per trigger (configurable in dispatcher)
- User feedback: Collected via "Helpful?" toggle and optional comment

Commit Value: 7/10
This implements a solid foundation for the popup system with proper database backing,
state management, and UI integration. The initial trigger (7.1) addresses an important
user experience issue - reminding users to maintain emotional regulation awareness
during task completion. The infrastructure is extensible for future triggers and includes
good practices like cooldowns, daily caps, and user feedback collection. The tiered
messaging system provides progressive depth without being intrusive. The main limitation
is that the settings UI for daily cap isn't fully implemented yet (separate task
planned), but the backend infrastructure is complete and functional. This is a valuable
feature that improves data quality and user awareness of emotional state tracking.
