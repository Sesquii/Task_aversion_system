# NiceGUI UI Layout Patterns

## Column and Row Structure
- Always use `ui.column()` or `ui.row()` context managers with explicit width classes
- For responsive layouts, use flexbox classes: `flex`, `flex-wrap`, `gap-*`
- Set explicit widths: `w-full`, `w-1/2`, `w-1/3`, etc. to prevent overflow
- Use `box-sizing: border-box` in custom CSS when setting widths

## Responsive Design Patterns
- Use min-width and max-width together: `min-w-[250px] max-w-[400px]`
- For multi-column layouts, always specify both flex-basis and max-width:
  ui.column().classes("flex-0 flex-[0_0_25%] max-w-[25%] min-w-[250px]")
  - Test layouts at different screen sizes; use media queries in CSS for breakpoints
- For mobile: consider stacking columns vertically with `flex-col` on small screens

## Layout Best Practices
- When nesting columns/rows, ensure parent has explicit width constraints
- Use `gap-*` classes for spacing instead of margins when possible
- For scrollable sections, set `overflow-y: auto` and `flex: 1` on container
- Avoid mixing percentage widths with fixed widths in the same row without flex constraints

## Common Patterns
- Three-column layout: Use `flex-[0_0_25%]`, `flex-[0_0_35%]`, `flex-[0_0_40%]` with min-widths
- Half-width columns: Use `flex-[0_0_50%]` with `max-w-[50%]` and `box-sizing: border-box`
- Responsive grid: Use `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for card layouts

## Debugging Layout Issues
- Add temporary borders: `.style("border: 1px solid red")` to visualize container boundaries
- Check that all nested elements have width constraints
- Verify flex properties: `flex: 1` for growing, `flex: 0 0 <size>` for fixed
- Use browser dev tools to inspect computed widths and flex properties
