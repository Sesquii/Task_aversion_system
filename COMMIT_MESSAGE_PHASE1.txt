Complete Phase 1: Server PostgreSQL Setup and Database Configuration

Phase 1 of server migration checklist completed successfully.

Server Infrastructure:
- PostgreSQL installed and running on Ubuntu 22.04 VPS
- Database `task_aversion_system` created
- User `task_aversion_user` created with secure password
- Schema privileges granted for PostgreSQL 15+ compatibility

Backup System:
- Backup script created at `/home/brandon/backup_task_aversion.sh`
- Script configured to use TCP/IP connection (-h localhost) for password auth
- `.pgpass` file configured for passwordless automated backups
- Cron job configured for daily automated backups at 2 AM

Documentation Updates:
- Updated `docs/server_migration_checklist.md` with Phase 1 completion status
- Added troubleshooting for PostgreSQL peer authentication issues
- Added `.pgpass` configuration instructions for automated backups
- Added Windows PostgreSQL client setup instructions
- Updated deployment plan to reflect Phase 1 completion

Security:
- Verified no passwords or sensitive data exposed in codebase
- `.env.production` added to `.gitignore` (committed separately)
- Database credentials stored only in environment variables on server

Next Steps:
- Phase 2: Convert SQLite migrations to PostgreSQL (local work)
- Phase 3: Deployment configuration (nginx, systemd, TLS)
- Phase 4: Code deployment and migration execution

Files Modified:
- docs/server_migration_checklist.md (Phase 1 marked complete, added troubleshooting)
