fix(analytics): update productivity score efficiency calculation to v1.1

Major improvements to productivity score calculation to fix negative scores
and prevent extreme values from very fast task completions.

Changes:
- Efficiency multiplier now compares actual time to task's own estimate
  (not weekly average across all tasks)
- Accounts for completion percentage in efficiency calculation
  (2x time but 200% completion = no penalty)
- Fixed sign issue in flattened_square curve calculation
- Capped efficiency multiplier: 0.5x min (50% penalty), 1.5x max (50% bonus)
- Capped work multiplier calculation: completion_time_ratio max 1.5
  (prevents extreme multipliers from very fast completions)

Impact:
- Fixes issue where productivity scores were negative despite working hard
- Prevents extreme scores from tasks completed much faster than estimated
- More accurate scoring that accounts for both time and completion percentage
- December 14th anomaly fixed (task with 30min estimate, 1min actual)
