git commit -m "docs(plans): add task management modes and repetitive task tracking analysis

Add comprehensive planning documents for implementing configurable task tracking
modes to support different user workflows and edge cases like repetitive tasks
and simultaneous work.

Plans added:
1. Repetitive Task and Simultaneous Work Tracking Analysis
   - Analyzes current tracking mechanisms (completion %, duration, over-completion)
   - Explores 5 options (A-E) for tracking manual effort and simultaneous work
   - Documents trade-offs and implementation considerations
   - Addresses edge cases where simultaneous work is valid

2. Task Management Modes Feature
   - Implements configurable tracking modes (Standard, Manual Effort, Accessibility,
     Completionist, Delegator, Template-Specific)
   - Phase 1: Fix over-completion cap (supports 500%+, not just 200%)
   - Phase 1: Implement Manual Effort Mode (Option A) as initial feature
   - Future phases: Additional modes based on user needs
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing 'standard' mode

Key features planned:
- Manual effort percentage tracking (0-100%) for active vs passive time
- Effective duration calculation for analytics
- Mode selection UI in settings
- Template-specific pattern classification
- Simultaneous task tracking for edge cases
- Time breakdown tracking for completionist users

Design philosophy:
- Gradual, incremental implementation starting with simplest mode
- Maintains emotional tracking focus while allowing workflow flexibility
- Optional features that don't disrupt existing users
- Backward compatible with current 'standard' mode behavior

Files added:
- .cursor/plans/repetitive_task_and_simultaneous_work_tracking_analysis_84141634.plan.md
- .cursor/plans/task_management_modes_feature_ff5510b8.plan.md

Purpose:
These plans address user needs for tracking:
- Repetitive, low-effort tasks (e.g., sending same prompt every 5 minutes)
- Simultaneous work (e.g., doing music task while waiting for AI responses)
- Manual vs automated effort distinction
- Edge cases where task splitting is valid (not punished by focus metrics)

The modular approach allows different users to choose tracking modes that fit
their workflow while maintaining the core emotional tracking and aversion
system design intent."
