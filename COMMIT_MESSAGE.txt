feat(security): add escape_for_display() to all UI pages displaying user-generated content [COMPLETE]

Add comprehensive XSS protection by applying escape_for_display() to all
user-generated content displayed in UI pages. This prevents potential
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by escaping HTML entities in user input
before rendering.

Summary:
- 23 UI pages updated with escape_for_display() for user-generated content
- All user-facing content (task names, descriptions, notes, labels, etc.)
  now properly escaped before display
- Consistent security approach across all UI components

See docs/content_display_escaping_fixes.md for complete list of pages and
specific escaping fixes applied, implementation details, and security context.

Security improvements:
- Prevents XSS attacks through malicious user input
- Safely displays HTML characters as text (e.g., <script> becomes &lt;script&gt;)
- Maintains display of legitimate text content while preventing code execution
- Consistent security approach across all UI pages

This addresses security concerns where user-generated content (task names,
descriptions, notes) could potentially contain malicious scripts that would
execute when rendered in the browser. All content is now sanitized before
display while preserving the intended user experience.

feat(error-handling): add handle_error_with_ui() to remaining UI pages

Add comprehensive error handling using handle_error_with_ui() to all UI pages
that handle user operations. This provides consistent error reporting with
error IDs and optional user reporting dialogs.

Summary:
- 25+ UI pages updated with handle_error_with_ui() for user-triggered operations
- 40+ operations now have proper error handling and reporting
- All user-facing operations (button clicks, form submissions, data loading)
  now use consistent error reporting
- Error report dialog allows users to provide additional context

See docs/error_handling_implementation.md for complete list of pages and
operations updated, implementation details, and usage patterns.

Error handling improvements:
- Consistent error reporting with error IDs for tracking
- User-friendly error messages with optional context reporting
- All errors logged with user_id and operation context
- Error report dialog allows users to provide additional context
- Better debugging and support capabilities

Note: Some utility functions (e.g., load_formula_settings(), load_configs())
use print() for initialization errors that occur before user interaction,
which is appropriate as they return defaults on failure.

test(security): SQL injection tests verified on local and Docker PostgreSQL

All SQL injection security tests pass successfully on both local SQLite
and Docker PostgreSQL (PostgreSQL 15) environments. Tests verify protection
against SQL injection attacks in:
- Column name validation
- Identifier quoting
- Task ID validation
- User ID validation
- ORM query safety
- Add column operation protection
- CSV import column name handling

Test environment:
- Local SQLite: Default test database (test_task_aversion.db)
- Docker PostgreSQL: Containerized PostgreSQL 15 on port 5433
  (to avoid conflicts with local PostgreSQL on port 5432)
