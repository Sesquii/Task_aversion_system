Move cancellation category management to cancelled tasks page

This commit relocates the cancellation category management functionality
from the settings page to the cancelled tasks management interface,
providing a more intuitive workflow where users can manage categories
directly where they're used.

Changes:
- Removed cancellation categories section from settings page
- Added category management (add/delete) to cancelled tasks page
- Category filter dropdown now refreshes automatically when categories
  are added or deleted
- Task list view refreshes to show updated categories immediately

Technical Changes:
- Removed unused sanitize_category_key() function and re import from
  settings_page.py
- Added sanitize_category_key() function to cancelled_tasks_page.py
- Added refresh_category_filter() function to update dropdown options
  dynamically when categories change
- Category management section added at bottom of cancelled tasks page
  with full add/delete functionality
- Default categories are protected from deletion (only custom categories
  can be deleted)

User Experience:
- Users can now add new cancellation categories directly from the
  cancelled tasks management interface
- Category management is co-located with cancelled task viewing and
  editing, making the workflow more intuitive
- Settings page description updated to indicate categories can be
  managed in the cancelled tasks interface

  unused imports and functions
