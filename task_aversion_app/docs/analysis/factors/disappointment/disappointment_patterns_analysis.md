### Analysis of High Completion + Disappointment

- **Average time ratio**: 1.13x (spent 1.1x longer than estimated)
- **Instances with time ratio > 1.5x**: 7 (spent significantly longer than estimated)

### Interpretation

These instances show that disappointment can occur even when tasks are fully completed.
Possible reasons:
- Task took longer than expected (time ratio > 1.0)
- Actual relief was lower than expected relief
- Both factors combined

**Key Insight**: When disappointment occurs with 100%+ completion, it indicates:
1. **Grit/Resilience**: Persisting through disappointment to complete the task
2. **Expectation Mismatch**: Expected relief was higher than actual relief
3. **Time Investment**: May have spent more time than anticipated

## Comparison: Partial Completion (<100%) with Disappointment

For comparison, here are some instances where disappointment occurred with partial completion:

| Task Name | Completion % | Disappointment | Time Ratio |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Task Aversion project | 15% | 44.00 | 1.00x |
| Chat | 65% | 3.00 | 0.79x |
| Task Aversion project | 30% | 37.00 | 1.33x |
| Task Aversion project | 50% | 18.00 | 3.33x |
| Task Aversion project | 80% | 29.00 | 0.95x |
| Task Aversion project | 50% | 5.00 | 1.50x |
| Task Aversion project | 90% | 9.00 | 1.45x |
| Videogames | 20% | 40.00 | 0.20x |

**Key Difference**:
- **High completion + disappointment**: Indicates grit (persisting despite disappointment)
- **Low completion + disappointment**: Indicates lack of grit (giving up due to disappointment)
