Add Task Editing Manager with chronological pagination and dual edit buttons

This commit introduces a comprehensive Task Editing Manager system that
replaces the separate cancelled tasks management interface. The new system
allows users to edit both completed and cancelled tasks from a unified
interface with chronological ordering, pagination, and direct navigation
to initialization and completion editing pages.

Changes:
- Replaced "Manage Cancelled Tasks" button in settings with "Task Editing
  Manager" button
- Created new unified task editing interface showing completed and cancelled
  tasks in chronological order (most recent first)
- Added pagination support (25 tasks per page) with Previous/Next navigation
- Completed tasks now have two edit buttons: "Edit Init" and "Edit Completion"
- Cancelled tasks retain single edit button that opens cancellation dialog
- Tasks are labeled with status badges (COMPLETED/CANCELLED) for clarity
- Filter dropdown allows filtering by All/Completed/Cancelled status

Technical Changes:
- Created new task_editing_manager.py module with pagination logic and
  chronological sorting
- Added get_all_tasks_chronologically() function to combine and sort tasks
  by completed_at/cancelled_at timestamps
- Implemented PageState class for pagination state management
- Updated initialize_task.py to support edit mode for completed tasks:
  - Detects edit mode via query parameter
  - Loads existing predicted values instead of defaults
  - Skips popup evaluations in edit mode
  - Marks task as edited and navigates back to editing manager
- Updated complete_task.py to support edit mode for completed tasks:
  - Loads all existing values including completion percentage and notes
  - Allows full editing of all completion fields
  - Uses update methods instead of complete_instance() to preserve status
  - Marks task as edited and navigates back to editing manager
- Added mark_instance_as_edited() function to track edited tasks with
  timestamp in actual data (is_edited flag and edited_at timestamp)
- Added helper functions _update_actual_data_csv() and _update_actual_data_db()
  for updating instance actual data when editing completed tasks

User Experience:
- Unified interface for managing both completed and cancelled tasks
- Chronological ordering provides better context of task history
- Pagination improves performance with large task lists
- Direct navigation buttons for completed tasks allow quick access to
  edit initialization or completion data separately
- Status badges make it easy to distinguish task types at a glance
- Edited tasks are clearly marked with [EDITED] label and timestamp
- Filter dropdown allows users to focus on specific task types

  /cancelled-tasks to /task-editing-manager
- ui/task_editing_manager.py: New file with complete editing interface,
