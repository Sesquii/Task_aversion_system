Files created:
- task_aversion_app/backend/productivity_tracker.py
- task_aversion_app/ui/productivity_goals_experimental.py

Files modified:
- task_aversion_app/app.py (add experimental UI import)
- task_aversion_app/backend/analytics.py (goal-based score adjustments)
- task_aversion_app/backend/user_state.py (goal settings management)

Purpose:
This feature enables users to set weekly productivity hour goals and
receive score adjustments based on goal achievement. The system supports
automatic initialization from historical data, manual setting, or hybrid
approaches. Goal achievement ratios above 120% receive bonuses, while
ratios below 80% receive penalties, encouraging consistent productivity
goal adherence."
