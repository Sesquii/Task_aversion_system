Goals Page Milestone Tree Redesign

Redesign goals page with collapsible tree navigation and 4-column layout for
comprehensive task and milestone management.

Database Changes:
- Add milestones table with scope support (global/template/job)
- Add milestone_id foreign key to task_instances
- Add instance_notes JSON field to task_instances for structured notes
  (initialization, pause, completion)
- Migration script to move existing 6 milestones from user_state to database
  as template-specific milestones for "Task Aversion System" template

Backend:
- Create MilestoneManager with dual backend support (database/CSV)
- Add milestone assignment methods to InstanceManager
- Add instance notes management (initialization, pause, completion)
- Support milestone progress tracking and counting

UI Redesign (goals_page.py):
- Column 1 (1/4 width): Collapsible task tree with IDE-like navigation
  - Tree structure: Global Milestones → Task Types → Jobs (optional) →
    Job Milestones → Templates → Template Milestones → Instances
  - Right-click context menus for edit/copy/initialize/assign actions
  - Hover tooltips showing instance initialization notes
  - Toggle for completed tasks view (shows counts per milestone/template)
  - Bottom totals bar (initialized/completed tasks, milestone status counts)
- Column 2 (1/4 width): Task details with tabbed interface
  - Most recently opened task shown by default
  - Editable instance fields (predicted/actual JSON data)
  - Double-click instances in tree to open in persistent tabs
- Column 3 (1/4 width): All initialized tasks list
  - Toggle: "Show All" / "Show Unassigned Only"
  - Compact display matching dashboard's recently completed style
- Column 4 (1/4 width): Template initialization
  - Searchable template list (without metrics/completed/recent sections)
  - Initialize and create new template buttons

Features:
- Manual milestone assignment to instances (single milestone per instance)
- Instance notes tracking: initialization, pause (per-pause array), completion
- Global milestone counting: tracks instances assigned to any template/job milestone
- Tree state persistence (expanded/collapsed, selected node)
- Jobs system integration ready (optional job level in tree)

Integration:
- Update initialize_task.py to capture initialization notes and optional
  milestone assignment
- Update complete_task.py to capture completion notes
- Update instance pause tracking to append notes to instance_notes['pauses']

Migration:
- Migrate existing 6 hardcoded milestones from goals_page.py to database
- Preserve milestone status and notes from user_state
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

Files Added:
- backend/milestone_manager.py
- SQLite_migration/XXX_add_milestones.py
- migrate_milestones_to_table.py

Files Modified:
- backend/database.py (Milestone model, TaskInstance updates)
- backend/instance_manager.py (milestone_id, instance_notes support)
- ui/goals_page.py (complete redesign)
- ui/initialize_task.py (notes capture, milestone assignment)
- ui/complete_task.py (completion notes)
- backend/user_state.py (deprecate milestone methods, keep for compatibility)
