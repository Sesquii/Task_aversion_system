feat(analytics): version execution module formulas as v1.0 and add migration framework

Version the execution score module formulas and create comprehensive documentation
and migration framework for analytics module development.

Changes:
- Version execution module formulas as v1.0 with complete documentation
- Create analytics skill framework guide for developers
- Add cursor rules for analytics module migration patterns
- Display version badges in analytics glossary UI
- Add version constant and docstring updates to analytics.py

Files created:
- docs/execution_module_v1.0.md
  * Complete formula documentation for execution score v1.0
  * All four component factors (difficulty, speed, start speed, completion)
  * Formula examples and use cases
  * Version history tracking

- docs/analytics_skill_framework.md
  * Developer guide for working with analytics module
  * Formula design patterns (exponential decay, piecewise, multiplicative)
  * Data handling patterns (CSV vs database, missing data)
  * Migration patterns and testing guidelines
  * Common pitfalls and solutions

- .cursor/rules/analytics-module-migration.mdc
  * Cursor rules for analytics module development
  * Versioning requirements and patterns
  * Formula design guidelines
  * Migration and testing patterns

- .cursor/rules/commit-messages.mdc
  * Rules for writing commit messages
  * Guidelines for when to commit vs just write message

Files modified:
- task_aversion_app/backend/analytics.py
  * Add EXECUTION_SCORE_VERSION = '1.0' constant
  * Update calculate_execution_score() docstring with version info
  * Reference to execution_module_v1.0.md documentation

- task_aversion_app/ui/analytics_glossary.py
  * Add 'version': '1.0' to execution_score module definition
  * Add 'version': '1.0' to all four component definitions
  * Display version badges in module header, formula section, and component cards
  * Visual version indicators throughout glossary UI

Purpose:
This change establishes versioning for analytics formulas, making it clear which
version of formulas are in use. The documentation and framework support future
migrations and formula changes while maintaining backward compatibility.

The version badges in the UI ensure users and developers can see which formula
version is being used, and the comprehensive documentation provides a reference
for understanding and modifying the execution score calculations.
