# Quick Installation Guide

## For Non-Technical Users (Using Docker)

Don't know Python? No problem! Follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

1. Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Download Docker Desktop for Windows (or Mac if you're on a Mac)
3. Install it (just click "Next" through the installer)
4. **Restart your computer** when it asks
5. Start Docker Desktop (look for the whale icon in your system tray)

### Step 2: Download the App

**Option A: From a Release (Recommended)**
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sesquii/Task_aversion_system/releases) on GitHub
2. Click on the latest release (e.g., "v0.1.0")
3. Scroll down and click "Source code (zip)" to download
4. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop (or wherever you want)
5. Open the extracted folder

**Option B: From the Main Repository**
1. Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop (or wherever you want)
4. Open the folder `Task_aversion_system`

### Step 3: Run the App

**Recommended Method: Using docker-compose (Easiest)**

1. In the `Task_aversion_system` folder, **hold Shift and right-click** in an empty area
2. Select "Open PowerShell window here" (or "Open Terminal here" on Mac)
3. Type this command (without quotes) and press Enter :
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. Wait a minute or two (it will download things the first time)
5. When you see "Application startup complete" or similar, open your web browser
6. Go to: **http://localhost:8080**

That's it! The app is now running.

**Alternative Method: Using Docker Desktop UI or docker run**

If you prefer to use Docker Desktop's interface or run the container directly:

1. First, build the Docker image (one time only):
   ```powershell
   docker build -t task-aversion-system:latest .
   ```

2. Then run the container:
   ```powershell
   docker run -d --name task-aversion-system -p 8080:8080 -e NICEGUI_HOST=0.0.0.0 -v task-aversion-data:/app/data task-aversion-system:latest
   ```

3. Access the app at: **http://localhost:8080**

**Note:** The `docker-compose up` method is recommended because it automatically handles all the settings (port mapping, environment variables, and data volumes). If you use `docker run` directly, you must include all those options manually.

### To Stop the App

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window
- Or close the terminal window

### To Start It Again Later

1. Open the `Task_aversion_system` folder
2. Open PowerShell/Terminal in that folder (Shift+Right-click → "Open PowerShell window here")
3. Type: `docker-compose up`
4. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Troubleshooting

**"docker-compose: command not found"**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check for the whale icon)
- Try restarting Docker Desktop

**"Port 8080 is already in use"**
- Something else is using port 8080
- Close that other program, or edit `docker-compose.yml` and change `8080:8080` to `8081:8080`, then use http://localhost:8081 instead

**"Cannot connect to Docker daemon"**
- Docker Desktop isn't running - start it from your Start menu

**The app shows an error page**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Try stopping (Ctrl+C) and starting again: `docker-compose up`
