feat(experimental): add productivity hours goal tracking system with configurable charts

Add experimental goal-based productivity tracking page as a distinct alternative
to the analytics page. This system focuses on goal setting, achievement tracking,
and productivity visualization rather than exploratory data analysis.

Implementation Approach:
- Created ProductivityTracker class as a dedicated service for goal tracking,
  separate from the Analytics service to enable focused goal-oriented workflows
- Uses weekly snapshot pattern with data stored in UserStateManager rather than
  real-time calculations, allowing for goal progression tracking over time
- Implements hybrid initialization approach (auto-estimate from first day data
  with manual adjustment capability)
- Goal-based productivity score adjustments integrated into analytics.py to
  apply bonuses/penalties based on weekly goal achievement

Database Migration:
- Fixed ProductivityTracker._get_completed_instances() to use database backend
  by default (matching analytics.py pattern) instead of relying on CSV
- Ensures experimental page uses actual database data for calculations

UI Features:
- Configurable productivity metrics chart with 4 view modes:
  - Productivity Points only
  - Productivity Score only
  - Hours (goal vs actual)
  - All 3 metrics normalized to goal/average (enables cross-metric comparison)
- Interactive chart updates via dropdown selector (follows analytics page pattern)
- Current week performance display with goal comparison
- Productivity points target calculation based on historical score-per-hour averages
- Basic weekly trends visualization (hours chart remains separate)

Note: Historical tracking data structure is implemented in backend, but full
integration with automatic weekly snapshots is not yet complete. The system
can record and display historical data when manually triggered.
