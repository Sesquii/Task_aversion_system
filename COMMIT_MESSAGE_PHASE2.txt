Phase 2 Cleanup: Export/Import Security + User ID in Models

## Summary
Fixed export to always include all expected files, added security validation to import,
simplified UI, and added user_id columns to database models. User data prepared for migration.
Local Docker PostgreSQL testing pending.

## Code Changes

### Database Models (backend/database.py)
- Added User model with OAuth fields (email, google_id, username, oauth_provider)
- Added user_id INTEGER column to Task model (nullable ForeignKey)
- Added user_id INTEGER column to TaskInstance model (nullable ForeignKey)
- Added user_id INTEGER column to Note model (nullable ForeignKey)
- Updated to_dict() methods to include user_id in exports

### Export Functionality (backend/csv_export.py)
- Always creates all 8 expected CSV files, even if empty (with headers)
- Added survey_responses.csv to export (always creates file)
- All files now include user_id columns in exports
- ZIP creation includes empty files for completeness

### Import Functionality (backend/csv_import.py)
- Added security validation: Rejects ZIPs with unexpected/additional files
- Added file whitelist: Only 8 expected CSV files allowed (tasks, task_instances, emotions, notes, popup_triggers, popup_responses, survey_responses, user_preferences)
- Added old version compatibility: Accepts ZIPs with missing files (skips gracefully)
- Added survey_responses import support (import_survey_responses_from_csv function)
- Added user_id handling in Task, TaskInstance, Note imports
- Added recursive file search for files in subdirectories

### UI Cleanup (ui/settings_page.py)
- Removed confusing "Export Data to CSV" button (saved to server folder)
- Kept only "Download My Data" button (downloads ZIP to browser)
- Updated button label and description for clarity

### SQLite Migration Fix
- Fixed Unicode arrow character in SQLite migration 010 (TEXT → INTEGER)
- Changed to ASCII-safe text: "TEXT to INTEGER"

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created docker-compose.test.yml for local PostgreSQL testing
- Created test_local_migrations.sh (Bash) and test_local_migrations.ps1 (PowerShell)
- Created docs/local_testing_guide.md

## Files Changed

### Modified Files
- backend/database.py (added User model, user_id columns)
- backend/csv_export.py (always create all files, include user_id)
- backend/csv_import.py (security validation, survey_responses import, user_id handling)
- ui/settings_page.py (removed export button, simplified UI)
- SQLite_migration/010_add_user_id_foreign_keys.py (fixed Unicode character)

### New Files
- docker-compose.test.yml
- PostgreSQL_migration/test_local_migrations.sh
- PostgreSQL_migration/test_local_migrations.ps1
- docs/local_testing_guide.md

## Testing Status

- [x] SQLite migrations 009-010 tested locally
- [x] Export includes all files with user_id columns
- [x] Import security validation working (rejects unexpected files)
- [x] Import compatibility working (accepts missing files)
- [x] Download functionality working in browser
- [x] User data exported and downloaded (ready for migration)
- [ ] Pending: Docker PostgreSQL testing (001-010)
