feat(recommendations): add toggleable recommendation system with normalized scores and tooltips

Add comprehensive recommendation system improvements including toggle between
task templates and initialized tasks, normalized scoring, initialization notes
display, and detailed tooltip system for sub-scores.

Features:
- Toggle between "Task Templates" and "Initialized Tasks" recommendation modes
- Normalized recommendation scores (0-100 scale) based on absolute scoring
- Display initialization notes/description on recommendation cards
- Tooltip system showing detailed sub-scores on hover (relief, cognitive load,
  emotional load, physical load, stress, behavioral score, net wellbeing, etc.)
- Backward compatibility for mental energy/difficulty from expected_cognitive_load
- Use actual initialization values from predicted field with fallbacks to defaults

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed score normalization to use absolute scoring instead of relative min-max
- Fixed tooltip display using ui.add_body_html() pattern matching task tooltips
- Fixed mental energy and task difficulty extraction with cognitive_load fallback
- Fixed ui.html() sanitize parameter requirement

Technical Changes:
- Added recommendations_from_instances() method in analytics.py
- Updated recommendations_by_category() with normalized scoring
- Added recommendation tooltip CSS and JavaScript initialization
- Added comprehensive debugging output for recommendation system
- Changed tooltip positioning from fixed to absolute for proper display

- task_aversion_app/ui/dashboard.py
  - Added recommendation mode toggle UI
  - Added tooltip system with hover handlers
  - Updated refresh_recommendations() to support both modes
  - Added CSS for recommendation tooltips
  - Added JavaScript for tooltip initialization

Commit Value: 9/10
This commit significantly enhances the recommendation system's usability and
flexibility. The toggle between templates and instances provides users with
different recommendation contexts, normalized scores make comparisons meaningful,
and the tooltip system provides detailed insights without cluttering the UI.
The backward compatibility fixes ensure existing data continues to work correctly.
This is a high-value feature that improves core user workflow.
