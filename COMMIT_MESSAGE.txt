feat(analytics): add thoroughness factor with comprehensive visualizations and glossary module

Adds a new thoroughness/notetaking factor that assesses data quality and tracking
thoroughness based on note coverage, note length, and slider adjustment compliance.
Includes both theoretical and data-driven visualizations, plus a dedicated glossary
module for documentation.

## Core Feature

- **Thoroughness Factor Calculation** (0.5 to 1.3):
  - Base factor (0.5-1.0): Based on percentage of tasks with notes
  - Length bonus (+0.0 to +0.3): Rewards thorough notes using exponential decay
  - Popup penalty (-0.0 to -0.2): Progressive penalty for skipping slider adjustments
    * Starts mild (-0.002 for 1 popup) and increases quadratically
    * Caps at -0.2 for 10+ popups (encourages early correction)

- **Thoroughness Score** (0-100): Normalized score for display (0.5 factor → 0, 1.0 → 50, 1.3 → 100)

## Visualizations

### Data-Driven Charts (Plotly)
- Note coverage pie chart showing percentage of tasks with notes
- Note length distribution histogram with average and target lines
- Popup penalty time series showing frequency over last 30 days
- Overview chart showing component breakdown (base factor, bonuses, penalties)

### Theoretical Visualizations (Matplotlib)
- Note coverage: Linear progression from 0% to 100% coverage
- Note length bonus: Exponential decay curve showing diminishing returns
- Popup penalty: Progressive quadratic curve (starts mild, gets worse)

## Integration

- Added to analytics dashboard metrics (quality section)
- Added to analytics page with "Learn More" link to glossary
- Created dedicated thoroughness_factor module in analytics glossary
- All charts integrated into glossary with automatic display

## Technical Details

- Uses PopupResponse table to track trigger 7.1 (no sliders adjusted)
- Filters out test tasks from calculations
- Handles missing data gracefully with fallbacks
- Progressive penalty formula: `penalty = -0.2 * (popup_ratio^2)` where `popup_ratio = min(1.0, count / 10.0)`

## Value Assessment: 8.5/10

**Strengths:**
- Complete feature with calculations, UI, visualizations, and documentation
- Provides valuable insights into data quality and tracking thoroughness
- Well-integrated following existing patterns
- Comprehensive visualizations (both theoretical and data-driven)
- Progressive penalty system encourages early correction
- Good user experience with glossary integration

**Areas for Potential Enhancement:**
- Could integrate thoroughness factor into other score calculations
- Could add more actionable insights or recommendations
- Could track thoroughness trends over time

This feature significantly enhances the analytics system by providing visibility into
data quality and encouraging better tracking practices through progressive penalties
and comprehensive visualizations.
