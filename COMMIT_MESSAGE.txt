Reorganize UI: Summary page, productivity settings, and settings restructure

This commit reorganizes the UI to improve navigation and consolidate related
functionality. The composite score dashboard is moved to a new Summary page,
productivity settings are extracted to their own dedicated page with advanced
features, and the settings page is restructured for better organization.

Changes:
- Created new Summary page (/summary) with composite score and component
  contributions display
- Moved time tracking consistency from composite score page to analytics page
- Removed configure weights section from composite score page (now only shows
  component contributions)
- Added Summary button to dashboard header navigation (next to Analytics)
- Created comprehensive Productivity Settings page (/settings/productivity-settings)
  with basic and advanced configuration options
- Reorganized settings page: moved productivity settings to dedicated page,
  moved composite score weights and cancellation penalties to appropriate sections
- Added cross-links between productivity settings page and productivity module

Technical Changes:

- New productivity_settings_page.py: Full-featured productivity configuration
  - Basic settings: weekly curve, target hours (daily/weekly), burnout thresholds
    (weekly and daily), primary productivity task with bonus multiplier
  - Advanced settings: Component and curve weight configuration with multiple
    saved configurations, productivity score over time chart
  - Weight configurations saved to CSV (productivity_weight_configs.csv) for
    development and comparison purposes
- Updated composite_score_page.py: Now redirects to /summary for backward
  compatibility
- Updated dashboard.py: Added Summary button to header navigation

  settings with link to dedicated page
