refactor(scale): remove 0-10 to 0-100 scaling logic, make 0-100 scale native throughout

Refactor codebase to use 0-100 scale natively for all metrics, removing all
scaling logic that was "working overtime" to convert between scales. This
simplifies the codebase, eliminates the scaling bug where 9/100 was incorrectly
displayed as 90, and makes the system more consistent.

Features:
- All UI sliders now natively use 0-100 scale (were already correct)
- Updated task_schema.py defaults: relief_score (5→50), emotional_load (4→40)
- Removed all scaling helper functions and conversion logic
- Old data with 0-10 values is read as-is (no scaling, backward compatible)

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed scaling bug where values like 9/100 were incorrectly displayed as 90
- Fixed scaling logic that was too broad (checking <= 10 caught values already
  on 0-100 scale)
- Removed all scaling logic from display and calculation paths

Technical Changes:
- Removed is_0_to_10_scale() and scale_0_to_10_to_100() helper functions
- Removed should_scale_10_to_100() method from Analytics class
- Removed all scaling checks (if value <= 10: value * 10) throughout codebase
- Updated all files to read values directly without scaling
- Added comments noting that old 0-10 data is used as-is (acceptable since
  it was only used for a short time and won't skew results)

Files modified:
- task_aversion_app/backend/task_schema.py
  - Updated relief_score: range_hint "0-10" → "0-100", default 5 → 50
  - Updated emotional_load: range_hint "0-10" → "0-100", default 4 → 40

- task_aversion_app/ui/dashboard.py
  - Removed is_0_to_10_scale() and scale_0_to_10_to_100() helper functions
  - Removed all scaling logic from display functions (relief, mental energy,
    difficulty, physical load, emotional load, motivation)
  - Values now displayed directly without scaling

- task_aversion_app/ui/complete_task.py
  - Removed scaling logic when displaying predicted relief value
  - Old 0-10 values displayed as-is

- task_aversion_app/backend/analytics.py
  - Removed should_scale_10_to_100() static method
  - Removed all scaling logic from DataFrame processing
  - Removed scaling from mental_energy_needed and task_difficulty handling
  - Removed scaling from cognitive_load backward compatibility

- task_aversion_app/backend/instance_manager.py
  - Removed scaling from normalize_relief() function
  - Removed scaling from scale_values_10_to_100() method (now just ensures
    values are floats, no scaling)
  - Updated all scaling checks to just read values as-is

- task_aversion_app/data_audit.py
  - Removed all scaling logic from relief, cognitive, emotional, aversion values
  - Values read directly without conversion

- task_aversion_app/backend/data_archival.py
  - Removed all scaling logic from relief, cognitive, emotional values
  - Values read directly without conversion

- task_aversion_app/ui/factors_comparison_analytics.py
  - Removed scaling from _normalize_relief() function
  - Values read directly without conversion

- task_aversion_app/migrate_factors_to_database.py
  - Removed scaling logic from normalize_relief() function
  - Values read directly without conversion

Commit Value: 8/10
This refactoring significantly improves code maintainability and correctness by
eliminating complex scaling logic that was prone to bugs (like the 9/100 → 90
display bug). The codebase is now simpler, more consistent, and easier to
understand. While this doesn't add new user-facing features, it removes
technical debt and prevents future scaling-related bugs. The backward
compatibility approach (reading old 0-10 data as-is) is acceptable since that
data was only used briefly and won't significantly skew results. This is a
high-value refactoring that improves code quality and reduces maintenance burden.
