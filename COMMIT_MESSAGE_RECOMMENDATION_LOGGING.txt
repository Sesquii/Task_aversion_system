Add comprehensive logging system for recommendation effectiveness tracking

Implements detailed logging throughout the recommendation system to enable
data-driven improvements. Logs track the full recommendation lifecycle from
generation through selection to completion outcomes.

Features:
- Recommendation generation logging (metrics, filters, all recommendations shown)
- Recommendation selection logging (which recommendations users click)
- Outcome tracking (completion rates, relief prediction accuracy)
- Non-blocking logging (errors don't break the app)
- JSONL format for easy analysis (one file per day)
- Analysis script to generate insights from logs

New Files:
- backend/recommendation_logger.py: Core logging module with event tracking
- analyze_recommendation_logs.py: Analysis script for log insights
- docs/RECOMMENDATION_LOGGING.md: Documentation and usage guide
- RECOMMENDATION_LOGGING_SETUP.md: Setup and overview documentation

Modified Files:
- backend/analytics.py: Added logging to recommendations_by_category() and recommendations_from_instances()
- ui/dashboard.py: Added logging to recommendation button handlers (INITIALIZE/START/RESUME)
- ui/complete_task.py: Added logging when recommended tasks are completed
- backend/instance_manager.py: Added outcome logging in complete_instance() methods

Log Files:
- data/logs/recommendations_YYYYMMDD.jsonl: Main event log (JSONL format)
- data/logs/recommendation_debug_YYYYMMDD.log: Debug log

This enables tracking:
- Selection rates (% of recommendations selected)
- Completion rates (% of selected recommendations completed)
- Relief prediction accuracy (predicted vs actual)
- Metric effectiveness (which combinations work best)
- Time-based patterns and trends

The logging system is production-ready and will help identify improvements
to the recommendation algorithm based on actual usage patterns.
