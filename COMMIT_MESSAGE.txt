feat(analytics): separate focus, momentum, and persistence factors (v1.2)

Refactored execution score and grit score to properly separate mental state
(focus) from behavioral patterns (momentum) and historical patterns (persistence).

## Major Changes

### Focus Factor (Refactored)
- Changed from mixed components to 100% emotion-based (pure mental state)
- Removed task clustering component (→ momentum factor)
- Removed template repetition component (→ persistence factor)
- Now measures only focus-positive vs focus-negative emotions
- Returns 0.0-1.0 range
- Moved from execution score to grit score (emotion-based, subjective)

### Momentum Factor (New)
- Measures building energy through repeated action (behavioral pattern)
- Components: Task clustering (40%), Volume (30%), Consistency (20%), Acceleration (10%)
- Returns 0.0-1.0 range
- Added to execution score (behavioral, objective)

### Persistence Factor (New)
- Measures continuing despite obstacles (historical pattern)
- Components with user-specified weights:
  - Obstacle overcoming (40% - highest): Completing despite high cognitive/emotional load
  - Aversion resistance (30%): Completing despite high aversion
  - Task repetition (20%): Completing same task multiple times
  - Consistency (10%): Regular completion patterns over time
- Returns 0.0-1.0 range
- Added to grit score

### Grit Score (Restructured)
- New formula: grit = base_score * persistence_factor * focus_factor * passion_factor * time_bonus
- Includes persistence (continuing despite obstacles)
- Includes focus (current attention state, emotion-based)
- Keeps passion factor (relief vs emotional load)
- Keeps time bonus (taking longer, dedication)

### Execution Score (Updated to v1.2)
- Removed focus_factor (emotion-based, belongs in grit score)
- Added thoroughness_factor (note-taking, existing method)
- Added momentum_factor (behavioral pattern)
- New formula: execution = base * difficulty * speed * start_speed * completion * thoroughness * momentum

## Research Basis

Confirmed through research that focus is a mental state (ability to concentrate),
not a behavioral pattern. Behavioral indicators measure focus but are not focus itself.

## Files Modified

- backend/analytics.py:
  - Refactored calculate_focus_factor() (emotion-only)
  - Added calculate_momentum_factor() (new)
  - Added calculate_persistence_factor() (new)
  - Updated calculate_grit_score() (restructured)
  - Updated calculate_execution_score() (removed focus, added momentum + thoroughness)
  - Updated EXECUTION_SCORE_VERSION to '1.2'

## Documentation Created

- docs/focus_momentum_persistence_final_design.md: Final design document
- docs/focus_momentum_persistence_separation.md: Conceptual separation analysis
- docs/implementation_summary_v1.2.md: Implementation summary

## Value Assessment: 8/10

**Strengths:**
- Clear conceptual separation (focus = mental state, momentum = behavioral, persistence = historical)
- Proper placement in appropriate scores (focus in grit, momentum in execution)
- User-specified weights for persistence factor
- Research-backed design decisions
- Comprehensive documentation

**Future Enhancements:**
- Momentum popup at 5 tasks (next step)
- Take a break popup after 4 hours (next step)
- Additional components for recommendations (time-of-day, task type consistency, etc.)
- Testing with real data to calibrate weights

## Breaking Changes

- Execution score formula changed (focus factor removed, momentum + thoroughness added)
- Grit score formula changed (persistence and focus factors added)
- Focus factor now requires emotion data (was previously behavioral)

## Migration Notes

- Existing execution scores will be recalculated with new formula
- Focus factor now purely emotion-based (requires emotion_values in actual/predicted dicts)
- Momentum factor requires completed_at timestamps and task_id
- Persistence factor requires cognitive_load, emotional_load, initial_aversion
