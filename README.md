Basically a glorified to-do list with accountability elements.

it includes tracking for emotions and cognitive load and motivation etc per task to help generate recommendations for which tasks to prioritize to increase daily functioning.

the recommendation system is very primitive at this point basically just uses arbitrary formulas but i'd like to eventually use machine learning to improve the recommendations. manually determining factors is better for now though.

the workflow works and i use it for personal use, but it's still a work in progress as you can tell by the commits.


i'm still pretty new to coding but i think to use my code just clone the repo to your system and then run the requirements.txt and then the app.py file and it should work on windows! (you need python installed but we're on github so yeah)
